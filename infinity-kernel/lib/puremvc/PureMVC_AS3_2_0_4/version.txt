2.0.4 Dissallowed re-registration of Mediators in View.registerMediator.

      Modified View.notifyObservers to notify from a copy of the 
      observer list rather than the actual observer list, which may
      change during the notification loop. For more on this bug, see:

2.0.3 Added notifyObservers back to IFacade, where it is required
      if you are sending custom Notifications. No unit tests required.
      
2.0.2 Refactored View.removeMediator method, moving the logic for removing
      an observer into a removeObserver method (also on IView), which is now 
      called by the Controller.removeCommand method as well as the
      View.removeMediator method. This fixes the issue described here:
      http://forums.puremvc.org/index.php?topic=308.0 
      Also, the Proxy.removeProxy method only attempts to remove the Proxy 
      if it is registered.

2.0.1 This is the public release, due to the limited release of 2.0 which 
      did not contain onRegister and onRemove for Proxy and IProxy. Also
      Model, View and Controller classes have been moved together in the 
      core package. This has impact to you only if you are extending or 
      importing Model, View or Controller directly. Since access to 
      these actors is generally through the Facade, this should not be 
      an issue. 
      
2.0   This release breaks backward compatibility with any previous release
      because the package structure has changed to incorporate the language
      for this release. Also, the Mediator naming scheme changed to match 
      that of the Proxy. Now the constructor to the Mediator takes a 
      mediatorName argument before the viewComponent argument. This means 
      that you no longer need to override the getMediatorName method in 
      your Mediators, you merely send the name to super to be set in the 
      constructor.The Mediator also gets a setViewComponent method so that 
      transient view components are supported. The Model, View and Facade 
      removeProxy and removeMediator methods now return a reference to the 
      Proxy or Mediator that was removed from the Model or the View. This 
      supports dynamic unregistration and reregistration of Proxies and 
      Mediators. And the Facade now implements INotifier, adding a 
      sendNotification method. This method makes use of the facade's 
      notifyObservers method, and so Notifier's sendNotification method now 
      calls facade.sendNotification. This means that you never have
      to create a notification inside the facade and call notifyObservers,
      you may simply call sendNotification with the parameters in the same
      way that Commands, Mediators and Proxies do. It is left public in the
      facade only so that you may still create and send custom notification
      classes. Model and Facade get hasProxy method; View and Facade get a 
      hasMediator method to. Mediator and Proxy get onRegister and onRemove
      methods. Notification.toString method was fixed.
      
1.7.1 A unneeded break statement was in the view's removeMediator method after the
      refactor for 1.7. This bug was not flushed out because of a flaw in the test
      which has been corrected. Here is the associated forum post:

1.7   The Controller's registerCommand method was modified to only create the corresponding
      Observer for the ICommand being registered if no previous ICommand was registered
      to the Notification name in question. The behavior of the method is the same in that
      if an ICommand was previously registered for the Notification, it is no longer used
      and the newly registered ICommand is. However, the previous implementation created
      and registered an extra Observer, which could lead to the new ICommand being executed
      twice. Added removeCommand method to the Facade, which is passed through to the 
      Controller. Being such a little-used method its omission was intentional, but it is 
      included now as a matter of form. Added to the removeCommand to the IFacade interface 
      as well. An issue with the View's removeMediator method was fixed. The previous
      implementation iterated through the observer list, removing associated Observers,
      however this caused the length of the Observer list to change, leading to the 
      possibility that some Observers would not be removed when they should have been. The
      issue is discussed here: http://forums.puremvc.org/index.php?topic=145.msg478#msg478
      
1.6   The 1.5 removeMediator implementation created a new situation where after an 
      observerMap array was nulled due to its length falling to zero. subsequent calls 
      to removeMediator could throw an exception. This was because the method of removing
      the only reference to the array was setting the observerMap value to null for the
      observerMap key in question. This method was used since Adobe's 'Programming 
      ActionScript 3.0  > Core ActionScript 3.0 Data Types and Classes > Working with 
      Arrays' says: "You may come across code that uses the delete operator on an array 
      element. The delete operator sets the value of an array element to undefined, but 
      it does not remove the element from the array". However, this proves to no longer
      be the case. So now, the delete operator is used to remove both observerMap and 
      mediatorMap entries.
      
1.5   Amended removeMediator method to remove associated Observer references from
      the observerMap. When a notificationName's observer list length falls to zero
      the reference to the observer list is also removed. Added compareNotifyContext
      method to the Observer class and IObserver interface, which compares a given 
      object to the Observer's notification context and returns a Boolean indicating
      their equality. This allows the View to  compare the Mediator being removed with 
      the Observer's notification context without breaking the Observer's encapsulation.

1.4   Added INotifier interface and Notifier class. MacroCommand, Command, Mediator
      and Proxy all extend Notifier and implement INotifier. The sendNotification
      method in Proxy and Mediator was moved to Notifier and is now available to
      Commands. Also the protected facade property was moved from Proxy and Mediator
      into Notifier, so Commands now get the facade reference at construction time.
      
1.3  Obviated the need for AbstractProxy and AbstractMediator in applications:
     * Implemented sendNotification convenience method in Proxy and Mediator
     * Added protected facade:Ifacade property initialized to Facade.getInstance()
       on both Mediator and Proxy. The concrete Facade must be instantiated 
       first, but this call will return the concrete instance, even though the
       framework Facade.getInstance is called. 
           
1.2 - Removed old files that were inadvertently included.

1.1 - Repackaged zip and updated inline docs
