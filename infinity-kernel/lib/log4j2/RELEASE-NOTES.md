# Apache Log4j 2.17.2 Release Notes

The Apache Log4j 2 team is pleased to announce the Log4j 2.17.2 release!

Apache Log4j is a well known framework for logging application behavior. Log4j 2 is an upgrade
to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides
many other modern features such as support for Markers, lambda expressions for lazy logging,
property substitution using Lookups, multiple patterns on a PatternLayout and asynchronous
Loggers. Another notable Log4j 2 feature is the ability to be "garbage-free" (avoid allocating
temporary objects) while logging. In addition, Log4j 2 will not lose events while reconfiguring.

The artifacts may be downloaded from https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html.

This release contains the changes noted below:

* Over 50 improvements and fixes to the Log4j 1.x support. Continued testing has shown it is a suitable replacement
for Log4j 1.x in most cases.
* Scripting now requires a system property be specified naming the languages the user wishes to allow. The scripting
engine will not load if the property isn't set.
* By default, the only remote protocol allowed for loading configuration files is HTTPS. Users can specify a system
property to allow others or prevent remote loading entirely.
* Variable resolution has been modified so that only properties defined as properties in the configuration file can be
recursive. All other Lookups are now non-recursive. This addresses issues users were having resolving lookups specified
in property definitions for use in the RoutingAppender and RollingFileAppender due to restrictions put in place in 2.17.1.
* Many other fixes and improvements.

Due to a break in compatibility in the SLF4J binding, Log4j now ships with two versions of the SLF4J to Log4j adapters.
log4j-slf4j-impl should be used with SLF4J 1.7.x and earlier and log4j-slf4j18-impl should be used with SLF4J 1.8.x and
later. SLF4J-2.0.0 alpha releases are not fully supported. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-2975 and
https://jira.qos.ch/browse/SLF4J-511.

The Log4j 2.17.2 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.
